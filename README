List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,

DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:


WORD FINDER
Class Design: 
    - main() provides user interface and utilizes the two helper functions findWords() and printPossibleWords()
Algorithms and Data structures:
    - findWords()
        - ArrayList<String> foundWords: ArrayList is flexible and easy to add an undetermined amount of anagrams
        - TreeMap<String, Integer> wordsAndPoints: keeps Entrys in alphabetical order when printing
        - Set<Entry<String, Integer>> entrySet: contains unique set of keys
        - ArrayList<Entry<String, Integer>> list: convert back to list to be able to use "Collections.sort()"
        - Collections.sort(): specifies that each Entry should be sorted by their values
    - printPossibleWords()
        - Entry<String, Integer> entry: each entry contains a word (string) and score (integer), makes easy to print information
    

ANAGRAM DICTIONARY
Class Design:
    - anagramHashMap: contains key: canonical form, value: Array List of actual english words
    - process words in a dictionary and adds their canonical form to anagramHashMap if not already there, and the actual word
    - defensive copies of ArrayLists prevent unwanted changes in anagramHashMap
Algorithms and Data structures: 
    - anagramHashMap = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>>()
        - HashMap: allows for O(1) time complexity for insert and lookup
        - ArrayList<String>: ease of insertion using .add
    - Arrays.sort(charArray): Arrays have a built in sort function to sort characters alphabetically

RACK
Class Design:
    - private ArrayList<String> generatedSubsets: contains generated subsets of input str
    - Rack(): filters out non alphabet characters and counts character occurances
    - getSubsets(): return a defensive copy
Algorithms and Data structures:
    - ArrayList<String> generatedSubsets: ease of adding elements
    - char[] charArray: String split up into chars
    - ArrayList<Character> charArrayList: only alphabetical Characters
    - TreeMap<Character, Integer> countChars: count the number of occurances a character is in a word
    - Set<Character> setOfChars: contains a unique set of characters
    - Collection<Integer> counts: contains a collection of corresponding counts for each character


SCORE TABLE
Class Design:
    - Multiple ArrayLists, each with Characters that correspond to a certain score
    - Each ArrayList represents a different score
    - getScore(): Calculates the score for a word
Algorithms and Data structures:
    - ArrayList<Character>: ArrayLists only consisted of upperCase letters for simplicity. Easy to change
        which letter corresponds with which point
